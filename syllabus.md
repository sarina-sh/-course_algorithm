<h1>Course goals :</h1>
The purpose of this course is to teach the methods of analysis and design of algorithms. In this lesson, students learn how to analyze a problem and find the types of possible algorithms to solve it. Then find algorithmic solutions based on each type, analyze them in terms of computational complexity, and select the best algorithms for a particular engineering application based on the size and input properties of the problem. In this lesson, basic algorithms for Solving practical and common problems will also be provided to students.
